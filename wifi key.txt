App icon is horribly resampled

Boos list
	Displaying non-ascii characters?
	Managed to play a boo twice at the same time, hitting stop only stopped one.
	BooBot image is particularly badly aliased (different from boos without a gravatar)
	Show more of the title when playing boos?

Record screen
	Go to boos list, come back, Play & Trash icons appear as though there's audio
	can't seem to get back to the boos list once recording was started?
  Buttons don't fit the background
	Audio cuts out every 0.5seconds ish

Publish screen
	Add a bottom list item with icon for publishing?
	Presumably upload isn't finished?

Account screen
	Login surely won't work?
