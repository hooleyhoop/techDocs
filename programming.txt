Programming a Computer
----------------------
The instruction set
An app that turns stuff you write into machine code
An app the runs certain bits of code when it parses your code

You can emulate machines. You could write any language in any language

Lo level - Vs - Hi level
------------------------

requires a runtime vs doesn't require a runtime.

What does this mean? What does this get you?

no runtime - assembler, c


runtime hides the complexity or variations in the services offered by the operating system

java virtual machine

Language Features
-----------------

Start a project with the same thing each time (like oo in c) - build it into the language
- Could be a framework

so..
drip( tap1, 0.5, 7 )

becomes..
tap1.drip( 0.5, 7 ) // needs to add concept of self

added benefit is namespace

DO LANGUAGES EXIST?
-------------------

Learn a runtime
Learn an operating system libraries
Learn Libraries

learn the format of the code
