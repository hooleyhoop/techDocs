Navigation Controller 

• Install it directly in your application’s main window.
• Install it as the root view controller of a tab in a tab bar interface.
• Install it as one of the two root view controllers in a split view interface. (iPad only)
• Present it modally or otherwise use it as a standalone view controller that you can display and dismiss as needed.
• Display it from a popover. (iPad only)

Tab bar controller

• Install it directly in your application’s main window.
• Install it as one of the two root views in a split view interface. (iPad only)
• Present it modally to display some data that requires its own mode-based organization.
• Display it from a popover. (iPad only)

 Although a navigation controller can be embedded inside a tab, the reverse is not true.
