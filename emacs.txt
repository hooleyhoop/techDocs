All ``command keystrokes'' in Emacs (those that are M-x something or C-something) are actually just shortcuts to functions which are part of Emacs. You can call any of those functions by typing M-x function-name and hitting Enter. You can also use the keyboard shortcut for that function (if it has one).

For example, the Emacs function which saves a buffer to disk is called save-buffer. By default it is also bound to C-x C-s. So, you can either use they shortcut to save the current buffer, or you could type M-x save-buffer and achieve the exact same result.
To execute Control commands, written as CTRL-letter, hold down the Control key while typing the letter indicated. 
To execute Escape commands, written as ESC letter, press the Escape key (once) and then type the letter indicated.ttththt

As an example, try M-x search and then hit Tab. Emacs will append a hyphen to indicate that there are several possible completions but they all have a hyphen as the next character. Hit Tab once more and Emacs will display a list of the possible matches for you to choose from. Notice that it does so in a new window. It temporarily splits your display into two windows: one which contains the buffer you were editing and the other contains the list of possible completions for ``search-''. You may hit C-g to exit out of the selection process and close the new window.
